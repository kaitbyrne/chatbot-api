Response: I haven't had lunch since yesterday, so I'm going over to Callahan's.
Message: No, don't go there. They totally skimp on pickles. Let me go to Big Head Joe's for you. They have the most insane burritos.
Response: I don't much go for ethnic food.
Message: Trust me. They have one that's called the Meat Tornado. Literally killed a guy last year.
Response: You had me at Meat Tornado.
Message:
Response: I don't want this parks department to build, any parks, because I don't believe in government. I think that all government is a waste of taxpayer money.
Message:
Response: My dream is to have the parks system privatized and run entirely for profit, by corporations.
Message:
Response: I enjoy government functions like I enjoy getting kicked in the nuggets with a steel-toed boot. But this hotel always serves bacon-wrapped shrimp. That's my number-one favorite food wrapped around my number-three favorite food. I'd go to a banquet in honor of those Somali pirates if they served bacon-wrapped shrimp.
Message:
Response: Hey, Mark! This is Beth, my ex-wife Tammy's better-looking sister.
Message: Nice to meet you. You guys are... together?
Response: Yep. My ex-wife Tammy cheated on me, then we divorced, then last week I ran into her sister Beth here; turns out she hates Tammy too, so we started dating. It's like a fairy tale!
Message:
Response: Okay, here's the situation
Message: Thank you, thank you. Just a little something I know. So what's up?
Response: Uh, someone is on fire in Ramset Park. They need you to get down there right away.
Message: Pawnee has a gay bar?
Response: Yeah, The Bulge. It's behind my house.
Message:
Response: I have a hernia. I've had it for a while. And I've been ignoring it... successfully, but this morning, I made the mistake of sneezing.
Message:
Response: But as long as I sit still and don't move my head, or torso, I'm good. I got this.
Message:
Response: Hey Mark. This is Beth, my ex-wife Tammy’s better looking sister.
Message: You guys are together?
Response: Yep. My ex-wife Tammy cheated on me, then we divorced, then last week I ran into her sister Beth here, turns out she hates Tammy too, so we started dating. It’s like a fairytale.
Message:
Response: Tommy Boy. Let me tell you something Tom, you suck at Scrabble.
Message: I know, you‘re destroying me.
Response: You’re worse than my ex-wife. And she’s terrible at Scrabble. And she’s a bitch.
Message: Look out man, I’m gonna get you one of these days. I’m practicing.
Response: Yeah I doubt that. Her name is Tammy Swanson and she’s a serious bitch.
Message:
Response: No, I didn’t… I didn’t do it for Leslie. I did it because I hate bureaucracy. My idea of a perfect government, is one guy who sits in a small room at a desk. And the only thing he’s allowed to decide is who to nuke. The man is chosen based on some kind of I.Q. Test, and maybe also a physical tournament, like a decathlon. And women are brought to him… maybe… when he desires them.
Message:
Response: No, it’s not. This is not communist China. You can not make her whip herself. You can not make her wear a hairshirt.
Message: We weren’t planning on doing either of those things.
Response: This is America. You wanna live in North Korea… you can live in North Korea. I don’t want to. I wanna live in America. Leslie has never broken a rule in her life to the point that it’s annoying. If you wanna slap her on the wrist go ahead. If you wanna do anything more serious you’re gonna have to go through me. Lets go.
Message:
Response: Marlene, is a woman. She has worked in the government for three decades. Thirty years, properly applied, that’s how long a good varnish should last. So Marlene, it is true that you have won this award.
Message:
Response: I refuse to lather Marlene up, kiss her ring like everybody else. Instead I’ll be delivering a speech of facts.
Message:
Response: I like your hairdo Leslie.
Message: Thank you Ron.
Response: It’s just like my brother’s. He’s an officer in the Air Force.
Message:
Response: Bacon wrapped shrimp.
Message: Oh, thanks I’m okay.
Response: I wasn’t offering.
Message:
Response: The only reason anyone is going to this thing is because they’re afraid of what Marlene will do to them if they don’t. That women is tough. In 1994 I gave her a nickname, it’s unrepeatable, but it stuck. It’s my proudest accomplishment. It’s the iron (beep) of Pawnee.
Message:
Response: Hey, who wants to see me climb a tree?
Message:
Response: What exactly will you be cutting and how much of it and can I watch you do it while eating pork cracklins’.
Message: They’re here to slash and burn.
Response: Well, I’d be fine with that. This government is diseased. It’s like a big fat angry slob spending money it doesn’t have, on crap it doesn’t need. Mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm. Me want more pointless social programs. Yummy, yummy, yum.
Message:
Response: Hydrax cookies? Did you know there was an off-brand Hydrox?” “I did not. They’re not bad.
Message:
Response: We will get along just fine, though hopefully not too fine, because I am not looking for any new friends. End speech.
Message:
Response: I’ll take that steak to go. Please and thank you.
Message:
Response: Haha, Euro-trash, I like that. That is indeed a garbage continent.
Message:
Response: His barber, butcher, and lover. I have lost one of them today.
Message:
Response: Because this tree is strong and quite, and always there when you need it. Or whatever.
Message:
Response: I change my locks every 16 days. That key's been useless since the 2nd Tuesday I gave it to you.
Message:
Response: It's an impossible puzzle, and I love puzzles!
Message:
Response: Creativity is for people with glasses who like to lie.
Message:
Response: Tom is quite taken with you.
Message: He's taken with me, huh?
Response: He said he'd marry you tomorrow.
Message:
Response: Say what you want about organized religion, but those bastards knew how to construct an edifice.
Message:
Response: Also they called three hours ago, and said they approved the plans.
Message:
Response: I'm not a spy, and I would not reveal classified information
Message: Do you have to say that every time?
Response: Yeah.
Message:
Response: This is a flying robot that I just shot out of the sky when it tired to deliver me a package.
Message:
Response: Is Star Wars the one with the wizard boy?
Message:
Response: They do seem to, as they say, keep it "100."
Message:
Response: You think I would carry around pictures of my child where anyone could see them?
Message:
Response: Why do people eat anything besides breakfast food?
Message: Ron, you big fat giant sap!
Response: That seems unnecessary.
Message:
Response: Sure I loved shutting things down, bleeding the beast from the inside...
Message:
Response: I was going to ask you for a job. In the federal government - even saying it feels dirty.
Message:
Message: It's Terry now.
Response: Okay.
Message:
Response: That's the real reason I hired you. Those brownies were damn good.
Message:
Response: You called me a "heartless thug."
Message: I absolutely did not!
Response: You were tough. And honest.
Message:
Response: I'll do anything! I'll watch a foreign film! I'll talk to a man with a ponytail!
Message: You forgot the last sentence.
Response: No I didn't - I remember that part. It says "hire her."
Message:
Response: You mean I've had a toy on my desk all this time?
Message: You mean you thought you had a REAL landmine on your desk??
Response: I have my rights as a US citizen to blow a hole in that f*cking door and get out! It's in the constitution!
Message: There's no swearing in the constitution.
Response: That's not the whole story.
Message: What does that mean?
Response: It means what it means. That is not the whole story of why I left.
Message: Come on Ron, we were friends for 10 years.
Response: We were work proximity associates.
Message:
Response: WHAT IF WE HAVE AN EMERGENCY AND HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE?
Message: I DID NOT CONSIDER THAT POSSIBILITY!
Message:
Response: I would rather bleed out than sit here and talk about my feelings for 10 mins.
Message:
Response: I'm going to break out of here, then I'm going to snap you in half.
Message: You're the most unreasonable person I've ever meet and I'm not going to change my mind no matter what anyone says.
Response: You're bad at scrapbooking.
Message: That was all flash no substance!
Response: It was exactly as substantive as your presentation.
Message:
Response: This is a competition. We need to win it. Please do your jobs.
Message:
Response: Terry, what has Leslie been up to?
Message:
Response: It's f*cking milk.
Message: Please write it in cursive, it raises a lot of red fl-
Response: No.
Message:
Response: I prefer quality over flash - that's why I refuse to write my signature in cursive.
Message:
Response: Tammy does not abide by the Geneva Convention.
Message: Have you ever seen Monster's Inc?
Response: No.
Message: Ron, I just want you to know that I am not sorry for pushing your face into a cake.
Response: Well I am sorry - for attending a public event.
Message:
Response: Yes, the sky has land.
Message:
Response: Hello Knope.
Message: Hello former strange person I used to friend. You're looking very Ron-like.
Response: You have your same hair.
Message: No! I don't! I have bangs now!
Response: I've never known what bangs are and I don't intend to learn!
Message: Your family has made you a more patient and empathetic person.
Response: You take that back!
Message:
Response: Live your life how you want, but don’t confuse drama with happiness.
Message:
Response: Hello, Joe. My name is Ron Swanson. I am Donna’s work-proximity associate.
Message: I really like you, but you are a terrible person to talk to about personal stuff.
Response: Thank you, that means a lot to me.
Message:
Response:I don’t drink alcohol from that portion of the color system.
Message: You know when you go to the ATM and get money—is there an actual guy that stands there and gives you money?
Response: No.
Message:
Response: Spending the day outside alone sounds like a dream. I love being a father, but there are a few things I miss: silence, the absence of noise, one single moment undisturbed by a children’s tv program called Doc McStuffins.
Message:
Response: On nights like this when the cold winds blow, the air is awash in the swirling eddies of our dream, come with me and find safe haven in a warm bathtub full of my jazz.
Message:
Response: He now has that look that only comes with the pride of labor. Or…he pooped. Either way, I’ve never been prouder.
Message:
Response: My son is several weeks old. He is very familiar with the sound of power tools.
Message:
Response: I’d like to introduce you to my son. John, middle name redacted, Swanson.
Message:
Response: Veganism is the sad result of a morally corrupt mind. Reconsider your life.
Message:
Response: Dear frozen yogurt, you are the celery of desserts. Be ice cream or be nothing.
Message:
Response: Computers are mostly pointless, but that Yelp thing gave me a great idea on how to criticize people in places.
Message:
Response: Children are terrible artists and artists are crooks.
Message:
Response: There has never been a sadness not cured by breakfast food.
Message:
Response: Tom put all my records into this rectangle!
Message:
Response: I believe luck is a concept invented by the weak to explain their failures.
Message: Today is Leslie’s last day as a counselor, so everyone needs to be extra supportive.
Response: Already done. When I walked past her this morning, I gave her a kind nod.
Message: Ron, I want to do things the Swanson way.
Response: Wonderful. First rule. No conversation lasts longer than 100 total words. I have used 9. You have used 20.
Message: Oh my God, you are such a sore loser.
Response: I am not a sore loser. It’s just that I prefer to win and when I don’t, I get furious.
Message:
Response: I will leave my children $50 a piece. Enough for the cab ride home from the funeral and a steak dinner. End of discussion.
Message:
Response: The three most useless jobs in the world in order are: lawyer, congressman, and doctor.
Message:
Response: I’ve had the same will since I was 8 years old. Upon my death, I will transfer all of my belongings to the man or animal who has killed me.
Message: I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to have a weapon at work.
Response: Literally, everything is a weapon. That folder in my hands is far deadlier than this bow in yours.
Message: Ron.
Response: Last name?
Message: Done.
Response: Is that your name or are you telling me you're finished talking?
Message: Both.
Response: Done and Done.
Message:
Response: We only subscribe to two magazines: Reader's Digest and Ebony. Ebony was a clerical error but it was an interesting year of reading.
Message: Oh, we don't accept American currency, sir.
Response: This is the most wonderful piece of paper in the world. Of course you'll accept it. Accept it.
Message:
Response: Look, a clock. We don't have that in America. You call that a tower? Try the Sears Tower, friend.
Message:
Response: History began July 4th, 1776. Anything before that was a mistake.
Message:
Response: Great job, everyone. The reception will be held in each of our individual houses, alone.
Message:
Response: I warned you. Standard birth control methods are usually ineffective against a Swanson.
Message:
Response: I believe in cutting useless government projects. I also believe in cutting useful government projects.
Message: Ron, ask me if I'm sad.
Response: No.
Message:
Response: There are only three ways to motivate people: money, fear, and hunger.
Message:
Response: Normally, if given the choice between doing something and doing nothing, I'll do nothing. But I will do something if it helps someone else do nothing. I'd work all night if it meant that nothing got done.
Message:
Response: What's cholesterol?
Message: How many drinks of alcohol do you consume a week?
Response: One.
Message: That's it? One drink?
Response: One shelf.
Message: Do you exercise?
Response: Yes. Lovemaking and woodworking.
Message: Do you have any history of mental illness in your family?
Response: I have an uncle who does yoga.
Message:
Response: There's only one thing I hate more than lying: skim milk, which is water that's lying about being milk.
Message:
Response: I’ll represent myself as I do in all legal matters and livestock auctions.
Message:
Response: I'll have number eight.
Message: That's a party platter.
Response: I know what I am, son.
Message:
Response: I wish this office had only walls.
Message:
Response: People who buy things are suckers.
Message:
Response: Before we go in there, I want to say something. You are a wonderful person. Our friendship means a lot to me. And you look very beautiful.
Message: Ron, I'm going to need you to walk me down the aisle.
Response: It would be an honor. And the first time I won't regret walking down the aisle.
Message:
Response: Your house isn't haunted. You're lonely.
Message:
Response: The next thing you'll want to do is ditch the terrier and get yourself a proper dog. Any dog under 50 pounds is a cat and cats are pointless.
Message:
Response: I wouldn't know. I've never been hungover. After I've had too much whiskey, I cook myself a large flank steak, pan fried and salted butter. I eat that, put on a pair of wet socks and go to sleep.
Message:
Response: I did not sleep for one second last night. And I cracked the bottom of the toilet bowl.
Message:
Response: There's been a mistake. You've accidentally given me the food that my food eats.
Message:
Response: I’m going to get 12 eggs and part of a dead animal. Dealer's choice. Please and thank you.
Message:
Response: Girls, this is Ann. Talk to Ann. She's terrific.
Message:
Response: Son, there's no wrong way to consume alcohol.
Message:
Response: It might be cold outside but it's about to get warm all up in my jazz.
Message:
Response: This might be the first time I've ever wanted to attend an event.
Message: Merry congratuchristmas!
Response: What?
Response: I started working on something very important. Can you help me?
Message: Yes sir.
Response: It's a flight of stairs leading to nowhere.
Message:
Response: Breakfast food can serve many purposes.
Message: Hey, am I interrupting something important?
Response: Impossible. I work for the government.
Message:
Response: I’m giving you a non-electronic book made of paper from a tree. It is called Auto Repair Manual-1982. You will read this book from cover to cover then you will assist me in repairing the damage to my car. I will not report you to the judge but if you slip up again you will have much more to fear than some feeble government employee in a robe.
Message: What did you do for her?
Response: Fixed her pothole.
Message: Can we please make you into a princess?
Response: No.
Message: I think it would make Diane happy.
Response: Why does that matter? Shut up.
Message: I'm a mermaid.
Response: I'm the director of Parks and Recreation.
Message:
Response: I love nothing!
Message:
Response: Take this compass. All great adventurers need one.
Message: As far as all this firing stuff goes...I will not forget and I will never forgive you.
Response: I went to Paunch Burger and got a number two: Double Bacon Grenade Deluxe with hash browns, chili cheese fries, and one poached egg.
Message: Ugh, number two is right.
Response: Your work is appreciated. Eat some corn.
Message:
Response: These people are meat virgins. They'll have been taken by the grill and delicately and tenderly been shown the ways of flavorful meat love. Mmmm...the first time is so beautiful.
Message:
Response: In my opinion, not enough people have looked their dinner in the eyes and considered the circle of life. This is your dinner. His name is Tom.
Message: Can we at least have corn on the cob?
Response: No.
Message:
Response: Clear alcohols are for rich women on diets.
Message: You and I will embark in a quick session of heart-rate meditation, focusing on conscious breathing and opening the heart shakra.
Response: I'm not sure I'm interested in that. No, I am sure, I'm not interested in that.
Message:
Response: I have so many ideas. Some are simple like take down traffic lights and eliminate the post office. The bigger ones will be tougher, like 'bring all this crumbling to the ground.'
Message:
Response: Anyone want to go to JJ's for some after dinner omelets?
Message:
Response: I work hard to make sure my department is as small and as ineffective as possible.
Message:
Response: Jerry's work is often adequate.
Message:
Response: Never half ass two things, whole ass one thing.
Message:
Response: I never thought I would say this to you son, but you may be over thinking this.
Message:
Response: Thank you all for being here, let's get started.
Message: Wow, great attitude Ron.
Response: Sorry, I was talking to these ribs.
Message:
Response: I hate riddles, and other such nonsense. I want that on record, but something wicked with a book is my ex-wife's library.
Message:
Response: When I eat it is the food that is scared.
Message:
Response: Straight down the middle, no hook, no spin, no fuss. Anything more and this becomes figure skating.
Message:
Response: Tom, I'm asking you as a man to stop this immediately!
Message:
Response: What the f***?
Message:
Response: The important thing is the dam is never happening, and your dream has been crushed.
Message:
Response: I don't want to paint with a broad brush here, but every single contractor in the world is a miserable, incompetent thief.
Message:
Response: Tom, we're already late. Now be a man and sit on that girl's lap!
Message:
Response: We need to get Leslie something that erases the enormous emotional debt that has built up over years of this gift-giving imbalance.
Message:
Response: Ben and a much larger Ann. She definitely loves Ann.
Message: Awwwww.
Response: So it learns information about me?
Message:
Response: She's here.
Message: Who's here?
Response: My ex-wife Tammy 2. I can smell the sulfur coming off her cloven hooves.
Message:
Response: Of all my coworkers he is one of a small number of whom I do not actively root against...uh, there I go again gettin' all sappy.
Message:
Response: My first day of college my father dropped me off at the steel mill. He didn't think I should go to college, but I hitched a ride, enrolled, and learned a lot.
Message:
Response: Every two weeks I need to sand down my toe nails. They're too strong for clippers.
Message:
Response: It is a beautiful night for the end of the world.
Message: If the world was ending tomorrow I'd want to be with him.
Response: Well that's significant the problem is the world's not ending tomorrow.
Message:
Response: No home is complete without a proper toolbox. Here's April and Andy's: A hammer, a half eaten pretzel, a baseball card, some cartridge that says Sonic and Hedgehog, a scissor half, a flashlight filled with jellybeans.
Message:
Response: We have one activity planned: not getting killed.
Message:
Response: Anyone find any mistakes?
Message: Yeah, actually, in here it says that Pawnee is great, but in reality it's terrible.
Response: Anne was getting a little chummy. When people get a little too chummy with me I like to call them by the wrong name to let them know I don't really care about them.
Message: That's a really nice move.
Response: Thank you.
Message: You're welcome Lester.
Response: Leslie, NO! We use that stuff to burn warts off mules!
Message: You could go to jail. Jail, Ron. Ron, Jail. Jail, Ron, jail. You could go to jail. Jail. Jail. Jail. Jail.
Response: Are you broken?
Message:
Response: My first ex-wife's name is Tammy, my second ex-wife's name is Tammy. My Mom's name is Tamara... she goes by Tammy.
Message:
Response: Tammy 1 is my blonde chicken.
Message:
Response: I hope the rest of your day is cool beans.
Message:
Response: Knope, follow me!
Message: Just one second.
Response: Now!
Message:
Response: What are you doing here?
Message: Running away from my problems.
Response: Come on in.
Message:
Response: I don't have the material for Smores.
Message: You you do, I always emergency smore rations in my car.
Response: I’m Ron Swanson and you're Leslie f***ing Knope.
Message: Guess I'll be heading home
Response: Catching the number twelve bus to Satan's butthole?â€¨
Message: Actually I prefer the number 69 train to Humpsville Station.
Response: An hour ago an entire fireball consumed my entire face and it was far preferable to spending another second with you.
Message:
Response: I have cried twice in my life. Once when I was seven and I was hit by a school bus. And then again when I heard that Li'l Sebastian had passed.
Message:
Response: I think if you would know one thing about me it would be that I prefer laying wreaths to lighting torches.
Message:
Response: Hello Leslie, how long have you been sleeping with Ben?
Message:
Response: Chris, you have come up with a plan so spectacularly horrible that it might ruin the entire department.
Message:
Response: This is my favorite part about having a new city manager. They always try to shake things up and their ideas are terrible and it brings city hall to a grinding halt. I just grab a few donuts, sit back, and enjoy the show.
Message:
Response: I don't like loud noises and people making a fuss. And I especially don't like people celebrating, because they know a piece of private information about me. Plus the whole thing is a scam. Birthdays were invented by Hallmark to sell cards.
Message:
Response: It's never too early to learn that the government is a greedy piglet that suckles on a taxpayer's teet until they have sore, chapped nipples. I'm gonna need a different metaphor to give this nine year old.
Message:
Response: Is this everybody?
Message:
Response: I won't publicly endorse a product unless I use it exclusively and I really believe in it. My only official recommendations are US Army issued mustache trimmers, Morton's Salt, and the C.R. Lawrence fine two inch style oscillating knife blade.
Message:
Response: I want this night to get krazy. Get me a shot of snake juice. I hear it has a dope aftertaste.
Message: Do you remember what you said to me five years ago when Eagleton offered me that job and I asked you for your advice?
Response: Do whatever the hell you want. What do I care?
Message: Right, but then after, when I pressed you, what did you say?
Response: I believe I said that I thought we worked well together, and that I might disagree with your philosophy but I respected you. And I said that you'll get a lot of job offers in your life but you only have one hometown.
Message: Yes, that's how I remember it.
Response: Leslie has a lot of qualities I find horrifying. But the worst one by far is how thoughtful she can be.
Message:
Response: Everyone shut up and look at me!
Message:
Response: Who the hell is 'Fwarp'?
Message: I don't know. I couldn't really hear him. It sounded like his name was Fwarp.
Response: Get his number?
Message: No.
Response: Good girl.
Message:
Response: Here's mine. It's a hamburger made out of meat on a bun with nothing. Add ketchup if you want I couldn't care less.
Message: Sir, is there a problem?
Response: I'm just making sure no one ever has to eat this.
Message: Have you ever tried a turkey burger?
Response: Is that a fried turkey leg inside a grilled hamburger? If so, yes, delicious.
Message:
Response: Listen, I've eaten a commissary hamburger for lunch every day for twelve years. I just wanted to make sure this pointless health crusade won't affect the only part of my job that I like.
Message:
Response: The key to burning an ex-wife effigy is to dip it in paraffin wax and then toss the flaming bottle of isopropyl alcohol from a safe distance. Do not stand too close when you light an ex-wife effigy.
Message:
Response: The dentist pulled the tooth out yesterday but it's always a good idea to demonstrate to your coworkers that you are capable of withstanding a tremendous amount of pain. Response: Plus, it's always fun to see Tom faint.
Message:
Response: What the fuck is a German muffin?!?
Message: I'm just gonna sleep on the floor.
Response: It's called the "ground" when it's outside.
Message:
Response: It's like yoga, except I still get to kill something.
Message:
Response: All of you be quiet. Andy, she's mad because you said "awesome sauce" instead of "I love you too." April, he loves you. Stop being a child. Tom, you're clearly at fault here. Blaming Jerry won't save you. Jerry, we both know you were shotgunning funnel cakes instead of watching Lil Sebastian. So everyone apologize to everyone else.
Message: So everybody gather around. Let's grab hands.
Response: I don't hold hands.
Message: Chris is cheating on Ann. There's evidence everywhere. She's coming up here so they can have it out.
Response: Ask her to bring some garlic salt. I'm worried Chris doesn't have any.
Response: Ann, do you have any Mounds? Because all I can find are Almond Joys. And almonds give me the squirts.
Message: Hey, can I smoke in here?
Response: You don't smoke.
Message: Just askin' if I can.
Response: Are you high?
Message: I'm high on kaboom.
Response: I’ve established a scientifically perfect, ten-point scale of human beauty. Wendy is a 7.4, which is way too high for Tom, who is a 3.8. 10 is tennis legend Steffi Graf.
Message:
Response: You know, Leslie, the Super Bowl is in a couple months. I usually watch it with my brothers, maybe you can come by during halftime and shoot me in the head?
Message: We have a criminal emergency on our hands. Someone planted a gateway drug in the community garden.
Response: Call the cops.
Message: Then it will leak to the press. Then there will be an investigation, and they'll find my fingerprints on the manure, and then we'll lose our funding.
Response: You don't have funding.
Message: Ron! Did you get my text?
Response: No.
Message: Did you get my email?
Response: Mmm.
Message: Did you see that I paged you?
Response: I did not.
Message: Did you get my voicemail?
Response: I didn't.
Message: I had to wait until my dad fell asleep so I could steal his keys. you ready?
Response: I was born ready. I'm Ron F*%king Swanson.
Message:
Response: Okay, here's the situation.
Message: Your parents went away on a week's vacation and left the keys to the brand new Porsche? I'll just take it for a little spin and maybe show it off to a couple of friends. That's when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking. I picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking. this girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh. She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far. I guess that's why I didn't notice that police car. Well parents are the same no matter time nor place, so to you other kids all across the land, no need to worry, parents just don't understand!
Response: Someone is on fire in Ramsett Park. They need you to get down there right away.
Message:
Response: Leslie. Some guy who owns a gay bar sent you a cake.
Message: Pawnee has a gay bar?
Response: The Bulge. It's behind my house.
Message: The Bulge is a gay bar? The nights I've wasted there ...
Response: I like your hairdo, Leslie.
Message: Thank you, Ron.
Response: It's just like my brother's. He's an officer in the Air Force.
Message:
Response: This is my basketball court. I don't want to see any double dribbles. I don't want to see any three second violations.
Message:
Response: When I'm done eating a Mulligan's meal, for weeks afterwards, there are flecks of meat in my mustache. And I refuse to clean it because every now and then a piece of meat will fall into my mouth.

Response: Indianapolis is home to Charles Mulligan's Steakhouse, the best damn steakhouse in the damn state. I have taken a picture of every steak I've ever eaten there. June 2004: Porterhouse, medium rare, Bearnaise sauce. January 2000: They call this one, The Enforcer. February '96: The steak ribeye. The Whiskey: Lagavulin 16. The lady next to me? A bitch. Specifically, my ex-wife Tammy. OK, this is the first I ever went there. Look at me. Just a kid.
Message:
Response: Leslie, you need to understand that we are headed to the most special place on earth. When I'm done eating a Mulligan's meal, for weeks afterwards there flecks of meat in my mustache and I refuse to clean it because every now and then a piece of meat will fall into my mouth.
Message:
Response: What happened to the steaks that were in there when they closed? (tearily) Do you think they got eaten?
Message:
Response: You may have thought you heard me say I wanted a lot of bacon and eggs, but what I said was: Give me all the bacon and eggs you have.
Message:
Response: Encapsulate the spirit of melancholy. Easy. Boom, a sad desk. Boom, sad wall. It's art. Anything is anything.
Message:
Response: No, I don't care about their relationship. I just don't want to lose April. I would never be able to find a worst assistant.
Message:
Response: Why are you working the permit's desk, and why was that child clubbing your nuggets?
Message:
Response: I’m going to type every word I know! Rectangle. America. Megaphone. Monday. Butthole.
Message:
Response: Took her home. Polished her up. Bought a brand new ribbon off of electronic bay dot com.
Message: You're a joke. You're not even a man anymore. Oh, and by the way, last night I faked four out of the seven.
Response: So did I.
Message:
Response: Tammy and I are in love, and we're going to start a family together. In fact. She's ovulating. So if you'll excuse us, we're heading off on our honeymoon.
Message: Wow, where you going?
Response: It's too bad. I just taught her how to whittel. She made me this tiny sharpened stick.
Message:
Response: I am off to have a mid-morning pre-lunch with my lady friend, but I will be back in time for lunch.
Message: A relationship? With whom?
Response: A lovely, intelligent, self-possessed pediatric surgeon named Wendy.
Message: Sounds like a real whore.
Response: My ex-wife Tammy likes to check in every so often and make sure I'm doing OK. And if I am, she tries to [expletive] everything up.
Message: It appears you have an overdue book.
Response: Oh, do I?
Message: It's Not the Size of the Boat: Embracing Life with a Micropenis.
Response: Tammy.
Message: I think we should put Twilight in the time capsule.
Response: Leslie, no. We don't negotiate with weirdos.
Message:
Response: I am submitting this menu from a Pawnee institution, J.J.'s Diner. Home of the world's best breakfast dish: The Four Horsemeals of the Eggporkalypse.
Message:
Response: I like Andy. I'm surrounded by a lot of women in this department. And that includes the men.
Message:
Response: You are an unstoppable good idea machine!
Message: Let me go to Big Head Joe's for you. They have the most insane burritos.
Response: I don't much go for ethnic food.
Message: No no no. Trust me. They have one that's called the meat tornado. Literally killed a guy last year.
Response: You had me at meat tornado.
Message: Do I have to tuck my shirt in? Because, honestly, that's kind of a dealbreaker.
Response: Let it fly.
Message:
Response: I need to find someone to fill in for April. Now I know I'm not going to find someone who's both aggressively mean and apathetic. April really is the whole package.
Message:
Response: The less I know about other people's affairs, the happier I am. I'm not interested in caring about people. I once worked with a guy for three years and never learned his name. Best friend I ever had. We still never talk sometimes.
Message:
Response: OK, well I'm not very good at visiting people in hospitals, so I'm going to go
Message:
Response: Here. I didn't know what to bring you, so I just got some magazines and lipstick. Woman stuff.
Message:
Response: Haircuts, there are three acceptable haircuts: High and tight, crew cut, buzz cut. Are the scissors broken in your house, son?
Message:
Response: I have been developing the Swanson Pyramid of Greatness for years. It's a perfectly calibrated recipe for maximum personal achievement. Categories include: Capitalism, God's way of determining who is smart, and who is poor. Crying, acceptable at funerals and the Grand Canyon. Rage. Poise. Property rights. Fish, for sport only, not for meat. Fish meat is practically a vegetable.
Message:
Response: Under my tutelage, you will grow from boys to men. From men into gladiators. And from gladiators into Swansons.
Message: No it's not.
Response: We're getting pizza?
Message:
Response: Well, I am not usually one for speeches. So, goodbye.
Message: Is that bacon on your turkey leg?
Response: They call it a Swanson.
Message: Ron Corleone. This really attractive woman is my girlfriend, Lucy.
Response: Hello, Lucy.
Message: Hi.
Response: Whoa. Impressive handshake.
Message: Thanks. My father told me that a limp handshake was for weak men and communists. He hated both.
Response: Well done, Tommy.
Message:
Response: I accidentally told them what you're doing in an attempt to save some government jobs. It's been a very strange day for me.
Message: Every department's losing a Leslie Knope.
Response: No, Ben. They are not. No other department has one to begin with. Right now, she's single-handedly putting up some lousy concert for this city's kids.
Message:
Response: Sell the zoo animals.
Message: OK, to whom?
Response: Cosmetics labs, weird restaurants. I'm just spitballin' here.
Message:
Response: Right off the bat, we sell city hall. Let somebody turn it into a large gas station or a TJ Maxx.
Message:
Response: I’m an official member of a task force dedicated to slashing the city budget. Just saying that gave me a semi.
Message: We need to cut expenditures by 32 percent.
Response: Let's make it an even 40.
Message: How long is it going to last?
Response: If we're lucky this building will be empty for months.
Message: Why would anybody ever eat anything besides breakfast food?
Response: People are idiots, Leslie.
Message: I really made love to the pooch on this one.
Response: Screwed the pooch?
Message: Well, don't be such a baby. I cooked you some bacon for a trail snack.
Response: I ate it already.
Message: What?
Response: I could smell it in your purse before I even parked my car. And now it's gone and I hate everything.
Message:
Response: Leslie, my first wife Tammy tried throwing me a surprise birthday party . When I saw my friends hiding through the window, I drove to a gas station, called the cops and told them people had broken into my home. I'm not big on surprises.
Message:: Hey, Ron. Did we make out last night?
Response: Good god, woman. No.
Message:
Response: What's a not-gay way to ask him to go camping with me?
Message:
Response: What exactly will you be cutting? And how much of it, and can I watch you do it while eating pork cracklings?
Message:
Response: Leslie, what do we do when we get this angry?
Message: We count backwards from 1,000 by sevens and we think of warm brownies.
Response: Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Don't teach a man to fish, and you feed yourself. He's a grown man. Fishing's not that hard.
Message:
Response: I suffer from a disorder called Sleep Fighting.
Message: Wow, must be terrible.
Response: Only when I'm losing.
Message:
Response: I have to nap up. If I don't get a solid five, it kills my sunny disposition.
Message:
Response: April was supposed to be the moat that kept the citizen barbarians away from Swanson castle. Instead she blew up the castle and stabbed me in the face.
Message:
Response: How are we doing?
Message: So your department banned me from attending games just because I yell "you suck" at the players.
Response: According to the complaint, you yelled it at 5-year-old girls.
Message: Who suck! Why is that so hard to understand!
Response: I need anyone with a pulse and a brain to pitch in.
Message: Ron, do you need help with anything?
Response: No, we're good. Thanks. In fact, you can head home early.
Message:
Response: Round up whoever's free. I'm going to need more Ron Swansons.
Message:
Response: To me, this situation is a blood-soaked, nightmare-ish hellscape. However to Leslie Knope-
Message:
Response: A schlemiel is the guy who spills soup at a fancy party. A schlamazel is the guy he spills it on. Jerry is both the schlemiel and the schlamazel of our office.
Message:
Response: No, I'm bringing my workshop up to the Swanson code. And if the Swanson code happens to overlap with the city government code...
Message: Shut up!
Response: I understand that city codes exist. And I know why they exist. And I understand that you enforce them.
Message: OK.
Response: OK, good talk. Can you sign off on my plans now?
Message:
Response: Those dates are arbitrary. They're like those expiration dates that the government forces companies to put on yogurt and medicine.
Message: You've got hazardous chemicals over here.
Response: Yeah, which only I am breathing. It's the same liberty that gives me the right to fart in my own car. Are you going to tell a man that he can't fart in his own car?
Message: Ron, none of this is up to code.
Response: Sure it is. It's up to the Swanson code.
Message:
Response: Hey, Mark. Welcome to my haven. You're the first non-me to set foot in this building in ten years.
Message: Ron will show you around.
Response: Um, right this way is the exit.
Message: But, if you give a women's award to a mustacheoed, masculine man such as yourself, well then eventually people take notice.
Response: I don't want the damn thing.
Message: Well we're giving it to you. So, you're going to take it, like a man. So congratulations.
Response: Come on Leslie, you know I'm not sexist. I love powerful women.
Message: You do attend a shocking number of WNBA games.
Response: Everything I do is the attitude of an award winner because I've won an award.
Message:
Response: Which of these objects most represents women for this portrait? A pot? Or this deputy director Barbie? Isn't it adorable? She's got a little briefcase, her cell phone.
Message:
Response: Be proud of yourself. You deserve an award. Not this one, obviously. This one belongs to me. But some other one. Some other lesser award.
Message:
Response: Awards are stupid, which is why I fully intend to decline this nonsense and recommend it go to Leslie because she works really hard and I don't. However, she cares way too much about crap like this, which is why I can't pass up this opportunity to tease her about it.
Message: You're, um, Pawnee's Woman of the Year it looks like.
Response: Oh, it's about time.
Message: Duke, can I have your autograph? I love your music.
Response: You're mistaken, ladies. Move along.
Message: For our nooner, which is a cute word!
Response: Explain it to her later.
Message: Were you aware that all the entertainment and food was provided by rec center teachers?
Response: Would I have stayed if I knew that?
Message: I don't know. Would you have?
Response: Would you have?
Message: No. I wouldn't have. Did you hear Leslie make any promises?
Response: What constitutes a promise?
Message: A quid pro quo.
Response: Oh. Do you know Latin?
Message: OK. Thank you, Ron.
Response: Are we done?
Message:
Response: If I wanted to bring a large number of deviled eggs, but I didn't want to share them with anyone else, can you guarantee fridge space?
Message:
Response: How many courses will there be?
Message: Three
Response: Hmm?
Message: Four.
Response: Hmm.
Message: Not including dessert.
Response: So five courses.
Message:
Response: The whole point of this country is if you want to eat garbage, balloon up to 600 pounds and die of a heart attack at 43, you can! You are free to do so. To me, that's beautiful.
Message:
Response: After I got home, I drank six more glasses of whiskey and then I finished crafting this mall harp, using a bandsaw, a spokeshave and an oscillating spindle sander.
Message:
Response: Swansons have a preternaturally high tolerance for alcohol. My old man used to put Wild Turkey on his cornflakes.
Message:
Response: I think the entire government should be privatized. Chuck E. Cheese could run the parks. Everything operated by tokens. Drop in a token, go on the swing set. Drop in another token, take a walk. Drop in a token, look at a duck.
Message:
Response: I wanna punch you in the face so bad right now.
Message:
Response: OK good, because I have to run a public forum, supervise the maintenance crews and teach crafts at the senior center. Simultaneously.
Message:
Response: We can't have raccoons for the Christmas thing. They'll hunt the kids for sport.
Message:
Response: My name is Ron. You don't need to know my last name. Whoever wants to talk, go ahead and we'll be out of here in a tight fifteen.
Message:
Response: There's a bunch of messages waiting for you about a bunch of things I don't understand.
Message:
Response: Take it down a notch. You already won your Oscar, DiCaprio.
Message:
Response: Tom-cat, pull up a mouth. This buffet is unstoppable.
Message:
Response: Strippers do nothing for me. I like a strong, salt of the Earth, self-possessed woman at the top of her field. Your Steffi Grafs, your Response: Sheryl Swoopeses, but I will take a free breakfast buffet anytime, anyplace.
Message:
Response: Looking at her, I feel like she might be the perfect spooning size for me.
Message:
Response: This seems like none of our business.
Message:
Message: Be supportive, OK? Don't be all like, "No. I don't want to. I am a guy and I like fire, and playing hockey and eating meat. No, no says I."
Response: They'll only talk to you or me. And I can't go, because I don't want to.
Message: Look, if there's anything I can do to make it up to you.
Response: Sure, how about you shoot me in the head. Oh wait, you already did that.
Message:
Response: When I look at my palm I see a lady's mouth French kissing a dog. Is that normal?
Message: Well, the pain medication I gave you is pretty strong. Donna uses it for menstrual cramps.
Response: And just like that. The one tiny aspect of government I enjoyed was clubbed to death before my eyes.
Message: You're literally listening to turkey calls.
Response: Is this-is this not rap?
Message: Do you have a key in your shoe?
Response: No, no. I have a bunion that's practically it's own toe. Normally the pain howls through my loafers like a banshee on the moors, but these past three minutes its been reduced to a faint growl.
Message:
Response: I got my first job when I was 9. Worked at a sheet metal factory. In two weeks, I was running the floor. Child labor laws are ruining this country.
Message:
Response: Every time she laughs, an angel dies. Even telemarketers avoid her. Her birth was payback for the sins of man. But you know the worst thing about her?
Message: She works for the library.
Response: She works for the library.
Message:
Response: Tammy is a mean person.
Message: Come on, Ron. You can do better than that.
Response: She's a grade-A bitch.
Message: There we go.
Response: I’m a simple man. I like pretty, dark-haired women and breakfast food. But this stock photo I bought at a framing store isn't real. Today I got the real thing. A naked Tammy made me breakfast this morning. I should have taken a picture of it.
Message: It's really good to see you, Ron.
Response: You've aged horribly.
Message:
Response: Look, Tammy and I don't work. We are oil and water. Or oil and TNT and C4 and a detonator and a butane torch.
Message:
Response: So you talked to Tammy? What's it like to stare in the eye of Satan's butt hole?
Message: I knew that you had two ex-wives named Tammy, so I was hoping that there was one you got along with and...
Response: Nope. Hate 'em both.
Message:
Response: On my deathbed, my final wish is to have my ex-wives rush to my side so I can use my dying breath to tell them both to go to hell one last time.
Message: Does she have any weaknesses?
Response: No.
Message: What do you mean no? Everybody has a weakness.
Response: Not machines. I honestly believe that she was programmed by someone from the future to come back and destroy all happiness.
Message:
Response: Ann, do you have any Mounds? Because all I can find are Almond Joys. And almonds give me the squirts.
Message: Hey, can I smoke in here?
Response: You don't smoke.
Message: Just askin' if I can.
Response: Are you high?
Message:
Response: I’ve established a scientifically perfect, ten-point scale of human beauty. Wendy is a 7.4, which is way too high for Tom, who is a 3.8. 10 is tennis legend Steffi Graf.
Message:
Response: You know, Leslie, the Super Bowl is in a couple months. I usually watch it with my brothers, maybe you can come by during halftime and shoot me in the head?
Message: We have a criminal emergency on our hands. Someone planted a gateway drug in the community garden.
Response: Call the cops.
Message: Then it will leak to the press. Then there will be an investigation, and they'll find my fingerprints on the manure, and then we'll lose our funding.
Response: You don't have funding.
Message: Ron! Did you get my text?
Response: No.
Message: Did you get my email?
Response: Mmm.
Message: Did you see that I paged you?
Response: I did not.
Message: Did you get my voicemail?
Response: I didn't.
Message: I had to wait until my dad fell asleep so I could steal his keys. you ready?
Response: I was born ready. I'm Ron F*%king Swanson.
Message:
Response: Okay, here's the situation.
Message: Your parents went away on a week's vacation and left the keys to the brand new Porsche? I'll just take it for a little spin and maybe show it off to a couple of friends. That's when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking. I picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking. this girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh. She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far. I guess that's why I didn't notice that police car. Well parents are the same no matter time nor place, so to you other kids all across the land, no need to worry, parents just don't understand!
Response: Someone is on fire in Ramsett Park. They need you to get down there right away.
Message:
Response: Leslie. Some guy who owns a gay bar sent you a cake.
Message: Pawnee has a gay bar?
Response: The Bulge. It's behind my house.
Message: The Bulge is a gay bar? The nights I've wasted there ...
Response: I like your hairdo, Leslie.
Message: Thank you, Ron.
Response: It's just like my brother's. He's an officer in the Air Force.
Message:
Response: This is my basketball court. I don't want to see any double dribbles. I don't want to see any three second violations.
